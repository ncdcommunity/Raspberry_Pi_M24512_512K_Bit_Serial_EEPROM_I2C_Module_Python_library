# M24512

The M24512 device is a 512K-bit serial EEPROM.This memory device is compatible with the I2C extended memory standard.This EEPROM includes a built-in 4-bit unique Device Type Identifier code (1010) in accordance with the I2C bus definition. When writing data to the memory, the memory inserts an acknowledge-bit during the 9th bit time, following the bus masterâ€™s 8-bit transmission.
